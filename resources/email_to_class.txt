The class website is https://jhudatascience.org/intro_to_R/ - we may be posting additional content the night before each class and this is the most up-to-date source of information. The syllabus is located <here>. The <CoursePlus website> has drop boxes for submitting homework and projects.

Please note the following action items below:

*Pre-class software installation:*

You should have the following software installed before the first class:
1. Please install the latest version of R (4.2.0 as of April 22, 2022) at https://cloud.r-project.org/
2. Please install the latest version of RStudio (Desktop): https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/#Desktop
You can find detailed instructions on how to do this on the <website page for Day 0>. Note that if you have any restrictions on your work computer, you might need to work with your IT department to get R and RStudio installed. 

*Pre-class homework:*

Please complete the first module for Introduction to R:
1. Follow the quick lesson here: https://app.dataquest.io/m/499/introduction-to-programming-in-r

You can find detailed instructions on how to do this on the <website page for Day 0>.

*Signing up for the class Slack channel:*

We have launched a Slack workspace for the class. For those of you who are using Slack for the first time: Slack is a collaboration platform that allows connecting people within a group or organization. Here, we have created a Slack workspace to facilitate discussion within students themselves, as well as with TAs and instructors. We hope this chat platform will allow you to discuss and clarify lecture content and homework. Slack has worked well for that purpose in other classes' offerings, and we hope it will continue to be a useful tool for you. 

To join the Slack workspace "140.604.79 Intro to R for Public Health", follow the instructions:
1. Look out for an emailed invitation directly from Slack. You can also click this invitation link <PASTE> (expires after two days, please request another if needed).
2. Once you have added your email and password, you can log in here: https://14060479intro-sl95622.slack.com/
3. Once you log in to the Slack workspace, you should be able to see a welcome message displayed in the "general" channel which includes a short Slack tutorial too.

See everyone on Monday!

Thanks,
Ava, Carrie, and Candace
