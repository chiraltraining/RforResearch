## R Markdown

Please read through everything and then try the exercises.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

The way you can create a file like this in RStudio is: File → New File → R Markdown and then using the default or using a template.

This is a code chunk that will set up our packages and data. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(jhur)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

long <- read_circulator_long()
## take just average ridership per day
avg <- long %>%
  filter(type == "Average")
# keep non-missing data
avg <- avg %>%
  filter(!is.na(number))
```

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 

## Plotting some data

Here is code that will make a plot of the average daily ridership in Baltimore City for the Charm City Circulator: https://www.charmcitycirculator.com/.  


Here we plot a few days. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r plot_circ, out.width = "100%"}
# keep only some days
avg <- avg %>%
  filter(day %in% c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Friday", "Sunday"))

palette <- c(
  banner = "red",
  green = "darkgreen",
  orange = "orange",
  purple = "purple"
)

ggplot(aes(x = date, y = number, colour = line), data = avg) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~day) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = palette)
```

## Exercise 

Here are a few changes that will show you how to change small things in `R` code and the output it makes.  After each change, hit the **Knit** button again.

Here is another code chunk for our exercises. 

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
```


1.  Go through and change the colors in `palette` to something other than what they originally were.    See http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf for a large list of colors. For example, you could replace blue with red.

2. Add a new R chunk below the bonus instructions.You can use the insert chunk button or copy paste an existing code chunk. Include a lowercase x inside the chunk as the code. Thus it should look like the chunk above but without `<- c(1,2,3)`. Make sure you press the knit button after this to see what the new chunk looks like.


Bonus:
1. Change the days you are keeping to show `"Sunday"` instead of `"Saturday"`.
2. Update the options of the R chunk you just made (with the lowercase x in it) so that the output option is `show output only`. How does the chunk look now?
3. Create another  R Markdown Document from RStudio dropdowns: File → New File → R Markdown.



```{r echo=FALSE}
x
```
