```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(jhur)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

long <- read_circulator_long()
## take just average ridership per day
avg <- long %>%
  filter(type == "Average")
# keep non-missing data
avg <- avg %>%

```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

The way you can create a file like this in RStudio is: File → New File → R Markdown and then using the default or using a template.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Plotting some data

Here is code that will make a plot of the average daily ridership in Baltimore City for the Charm City Circulator: https://www.charmcitycirculator.com/.  


Here we plot a few days:

```{r plot_circ, out.width = "100%"}
# keep only some days
avg <- avg %>%
  filter(day %in% c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Friday", "Saturday"))

palette <- c(
  banner = "blue",
  green = "darkgreen",
  orange = "orange",
  purple = "purple"
)

ggplot(aes(x = date, y = number, colour = line), data = avg) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~day) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = palette)
```

## Exercise 

Here are a few changes that will show you how to change small things in `R` code and the output it makes.  After each change, hit the **Knit** button again.

1.  Go through and change the colors in `palette` to something other than what they originally were.    See http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf for a large list of colors.
2. Change the days you are keeping to show `"Sunday"` instead of `"Saturday"`.
3. Change the word `geom_line()` to `geom_point()`.
4. Create another RMarkdown Document from RStudio dropdowns.
