    "text": "What is R?\nR is an open source language and environment for statistical computing, data mining, modeling, and data graphics. It provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques such as linear and non-linear modeling, statistical tests, time series analysis, classification, and clustering.\nR is one of the most used business analytics tools. For example, Facebook uses R for behavior analysis related to status updates and profile pictures. Google uses it to analyze advertising effectiveness and economic forecasting. Twitter leverages R for data visualization and semantic clustering. In the 2016 data science salary survey conducted by O’Reilly, R was ranked second in a category of programming languages for data science."

    "text": "Why Do We Need Analytics?\nBefore an answer to above question, let us see some of the problems and their solutions in R in multiple domains.\n\nHealthcare\n\nProblem: Every year millions of people are admitted in hospital and billions are spent annually just in the admission process.\nSolution: Given the patient history and medical history, a predictive model can be built to identify who is at risk for hospitalization and to what extent the medical equipment should be scaled.\n\n\n\nInsurance\n\nProblem: Insurance extensively depends on forecasting. It is difficult to decide which policy to accept orreject.\nSolution: By using the continuous credit report as input, we can create a model in R that will not only assess risk appetite but also make a predictive forecast as well.\n\n\n\nBanking\n\nProblem: Large amount of customer data is generated every day in Banks. While dealing with millions of customers on regular basis, it becomes hard to track their mortgages.\nSolution: R builds a custom model that maintains the loans provided to every individual customer which helps us to decide the amount to be paid by the customer over time."

    "text": "Features of R\n\nR supports procedural programming with functions and object-oriented programming with generic functions. Procedural programming includes procedure, records, modules, and procedure calls. While object-oriented programming languageincludes class, objects, and functions.\nPackages are part of R programming. Hence, they are useful in collecting sets of R functions into a single unit.\nR is a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.\nR has an effective data handling and storage facility,\nR provides a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, lists, vectors and matrices.\nR provides a large, coherent and integrated collection of tools for data analysis. It provides graphical facilities for data analysis and display either directly at the computer or printing at the papers.\nRs programming features include database input, exporting data, viewing data, variable labels, missing data, etc.\nR is an interpreted language. So we can access it through command line interpreter.\nR supports matrix arithmetic.\nR, SAS, and SPSS are three statistical languages. Of these three statistical languages, R is the only an open source."

    "text": "Comparison to other statistical programming software\n\nStata: The traditional choice of (academic) economists.\n\nStata is more specifically econometrics focused and is much more command-oriented. Easier to use for standard applications, but if there’s not a Stata command for what you want to do, it’s harder to write something yourself.\n\nStata is also very different than R in that you can only ever work with one dataset at a time, while in R, it’s typical to have a number of data objects in the environment.\n\nSAS: Similar to Stata, but more commonly used in business & the private sector, in part because it’s typically more convenient for massive datasets. Otherwise, I think it’s seen as a bit older and less user-friendly.\nPython: Another option based more on programming from scratch and with less prewritten commands. Python isn’t specific to math & statistics, but instead is a general programming language used across a range of fields.\nProbably the most similar software choice to R at this point, with better general use (and programming ease) at the cost of less package development specific to econometrics/data analysis.\nMatlab: Popular in macroeconomics and theory work, not so much in empirical work. Matlab is powerful, but is much more based on programming “from scratch” using matrices and mathematical expressions."
