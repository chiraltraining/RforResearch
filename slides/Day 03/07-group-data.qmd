# Group Data

## Grouping Data 
- Grouping data is a fundamental operation in data analysis that allows you to split a dataset into subsets based on one or more variables. 
- The dplyr package in R provides functions to perform grouping operations on dataframes.
- The `group_by()` function is used to create groups based on one or more variables in a dataframe.
- Syntax: `group_by(data, grouping_vars)`
