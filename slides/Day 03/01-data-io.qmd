# Data IO 

## Data Input and Output (I/O)
- Data input and output (I/O) refers to the process of reading and writing data in various formats using computer systems.
- R provides several functions and packages for efficient data I/O operations.

## Reading Data into R 
- `read.table()` and `read.csv()`: Read tabular data from text files or CSV files.
- `read.delim()` and `read.delim2()`: Read tabular data from delimited text files (e.g., tab-separated or semicolon-separated).
- `read.xlsx()` and `readxl::read_excel()`: Read data from Excel files (requires the readxl package).
- `readRDS()`: Read data saved in the RDS (R Data Store) format.


## Writing Data
- `write.table()` and `write.csv()`: Write data frames or matrices to text files or CSV files.
- `write.xlsx()` and `writexl::write_xlsx()`: Write data frames or matrices to Excel files (requires the writexl package).
- `saveRDS()`: Save data objects in the RDS format.

## Reading and Writing Databases
- `DBI` package: Provides a consistent interface for connecting to and interacting with databases.
- `DBI` supports various database systems like `MySQL`, `PostgreSQL`, `SQLite`, and more.
- Functions like `dbConnect()`, `dbGetQuery()`, `dbWriteTable()`, etc., facilitate reading and writing data from databases.

## Working with APIs
- Packages like `httr`, `jsonlite`, and `httr` facilitate working with APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to retrieve data.
- Functions like `GET()`, `POST()`, `fromJSON()`, etc., help retrieve and parse data from web APIs.
