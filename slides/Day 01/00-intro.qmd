  * R for Research is an introductory course designed to equip learners with essential skills in using the R programming language for research purposes. 
* Why do you want to use R? 
  * The course focuses on the practical application of R in data manipulation, statistical analysis, data visualization, and reproducible research.

## Learning Objectives 

* `Data Manipulation:` Learn how to import, clean, and transform data in R for research purposes.
* `Data Visualization:` Master techniques for creating effective data visualizations in R to communicate research findings visually.
* `Statistical Analysis:` Develop skills in conducting statistical analysis using R for hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and other statistical tests.
* `Reproducible Research:` Implement principles of reproducible research using R to document and organize code, data, and analysis for replicability.

## Assignment Policy

- 20% of your grade will be determined by an assignment during normal class hours.
- 50% of your grade will come from a 5-10 page report that explores in further detail one of the research areas in the class syllabus
- We expect that students will use original data collection, whether quantitative or qualitative analysis, to answer the questions posed.
- 30% of your grade will be determined by your attendance and participation in class.
